# ACCESSIBILITY

## Bare Minimum
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensure that your app is compatible with screen readers like VoiceOver for iOS and TalkBack for Android. This includes providing text alternatives for images, labeling UI elements, and structuring content in a way that makes it easy to navigate with screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Implement keyboard navigation support to enable users to navigate and interact with the app using only keyboard input. Ensure that all interactive elements, such as buttons and form fields, are focusable and operable via keyboard controls.
- **Text Contrast and Readability**: Maintain adequate text contrast to improve readability, making sure that text is easily distinguishable from its background. Additionally, use semantic HTML elements, and structure content with appropriate headings and landmarks to enhance content comprehension for users with visual impairments.

## Best Practices
- **Semantic HTML Elements**: Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<h1>`, `<nav>`) to provide meaning and structure to your content. These elements help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the purpose of each element.
- **Alt Text for Images**: Include descriptive and concise alternative text (alt text) for images to provide context and content information for users who cannot see the images. Alt text should convey the same meaning as the image.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements can be navigated and activated using keyboard controls. Focus states should be clearly visible, and users should be able to tab through your app's interface in a logical order.
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles and Attributes**: Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of complex user interface components, such as custom widgets or dynamic content. This helps assistive technologies understand and interact with these elements.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure that text and interactive elements have sufficient color contrast to make content readable and distinguishable. Use tools like color contrast checkers to verify compliance with accessibility guidelines.
- **Consistent and Predictable Navigation**: Maintain a consistent and predictable navigation structure throughout your app. Users should be able to understand and anticipate how to move through the app.
- **Form Accessibility**: Make form elements, such as input fields and checkboxes, accessible by associating them with appropriate labels. Consider grouping related form elements and providing error messages in a clear and accessible manner.
- **Skip to Content Link**: Include a "skip to content" link at the top of your pages that allows keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation menus and jump directly to the main content.
- **Testing with Assistive Technologies**: Regularly test your app with assistive technologies like screen readers (e.g., VoiceOver, TalkBack) to ensure that the user experience is seamless for individuals with disabilities.
- **Documentation and Training**: Provide documentation and training for your development team on accessibility best practices. Foster a culture of accessibility awareness and accountability.
- **Regular Audits and Testing**: Conduct regular accessibility audits and testing to identify and address issues. Use automated testing tools and manual testing with assistive technologies to verify compliance.
- **User Feedback and Inclusivity**: Encourage and incorporate user feedback from individuals with disabilities. Actively involve people with diverse accessibility needs in the development process to gain insights and ensure inclusivity.

## Tools
- **axe**: The "axe" suite of accessibility testing tools, including "axe-core" and "axe-android," can be used to perform automated accessibility testing on web and mobile applications. They provide actionable insights and recommendations for improving accessibility.
- **React Native Accessibility API**: React Native provides built-in accessibility features through its Accessibility API. You can use this API to set accessibility labels, roles, traits, and other attributes for UI elements.
- **Accessibility Insights**: Accessibility Insights, available as a browser extension and as a command-line tool, helps identify and fix accessibility issues in web applications, including React Native web views.
- **React Native Accessibility Inspector**: This built-in development tool for React Native allows you to inspect and debug the accessibility properties and hierarchy of UI components during development.
- **VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)**: These are screen readers built into iOS and Android devices, respectively. Testing your app with these built-in screen readers is essential for understanding the user experience for individuals with visual impairments.
- **Color Contrast Checkers**: Tools like WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker or the WAVE Evaluation Tool can help you assess the color contrast of text and background elements in your app.
- **Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)**: Lighthouse is a web development tool that includes an accessibility audit feature. While primarily for web applications, it can help identify and address accessibility issues in web views within your React Native app.

	*For an average React Native application, it's recommended to start with built-in tools and libraries, such as the React Native Accessibility API and the React Native Accessibility Inspector, to ensure that your app meets minimum accessibility standards. However, you should also consider using external tools like "axe" for more in-depth automated testing and compliance verification. Regular manual testing with screen readers like VoiceOver and TalkBack is crucial to gain insights into the user experience and make necessary improvements.*
