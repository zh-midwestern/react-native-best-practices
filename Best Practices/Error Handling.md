# ERROR HANDLING

## Bare Minimum
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provide clear and user-friendly error messages that convey what went wrong and offer guidance on how users can resolve the issue. Avoid cryptic error messages that leave users confused.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and error monitoring systems that capture, log, and report errors in your app. This enables developers to identify and address issues promptly and proactively, ensuring a smoother user experience.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design your app to gracefully degrade in the face of errors or unexpected issues. Ensure that critical functionality remains available, and that users can continue to use the app even when certain features are temporarily affected.

## Best Practices
- **Use Try-Catch Blocks**: Wrap potentially error-prone code in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent app crashes.
- **Consistent Error Messages**: Maintain a consistent format for error messages to help developers and users quickly understand and address issues.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Create custom error classes or functions to provide meaningful error types and messages for different scenarios, making it easier to identify and manage errors.
- **Error Logging**: Implement error logging to capture and store error details, including stack traces, timestamps, and user-related information. Services like Sentry or Crashlytics can assist in collecting and monitoring errors.
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Present user-friendly error messages that guide users on how to resolve the issue or take appropriate action. Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages.
- **Network Request Errors**: Handle network request errors gracefully by providing feedback to users when requests fail. Implement retries and offline mode support when appropriate.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implement client-side validation to catch and handle input errors before sending data to the server, reducing the likelihood of server-side errors.
- **Offline Handling**: Prepare for offline scenarios by caching data locally and displaying informative messages when the app is unable to connect to the server.
- **Error Boundaries**: Use error boundaries in React components to capture and handle errors in a controlled manner, preventing them from propagating throughout the app.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to cover error scenarios and ensure that error handling mechanisms are working as expected.
- **User Feedback and Reporting**: Allow users to report errors or issues directly within the app, providing a way for users to contribute valuable feedback.
- **Documentation**: Document your error handling approach and error codes for team members and future developers working on the project.

## Tools
- **Sentry**: Sentry is a popular error monitoring and reporting platform that works well with React Native. It provides real-time error tracking, crash reporting, and performance monitoring. Sentry offers a comprehensive solution for identifying and resolving issues in your app.
- **Crashlytics**: Crashlytics, part of Firebase, is a reliable tool for crash reporting in React Native apps. It offers real-time crash reporting and detailed crash logs, making it easy to pinpoint and address issues. Crashlytics is suitable for apps that rely on Firebase services.
- **Bugsnag**: Bugsnag is an error monitoring and stability management platform that can be integrated with React Native projects. It provides detailed error reports, automatic breadcrumbs, and proactive issue detection. Bugsnag is a solid choice for monitoring and addressing errors in average-sized applications. 

	*For an average React Native application, Sentry is recommended due to its comprehensive error monitoring and reporting capabilities, as well as its user-friendly interface. It offers a range of features to capture and manage errors effectively, helping to maintain app stability and user satisfaction.*
