# VERSION CONTROL

## Bare Minimum
- **Git Repository**: Create and maintain a Git repository for your project. Ensure that all project code is committed to the repository, allowing you to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Branching Strategy**: Establish a clear branching strategy that defines how features, bug fixes, and changes are managed using branches. Common strategies include using feature branches, release branches, and a main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
- **Commit Messages**: Enforce a consistent and informative commit message format. Commit messages should be concise, meaningful, and describe the purpose of the change. This helps team members understand the history of the project and facilitates code review and troubleshooting.

## Best Practices
- **Use Git**: Git is the most widely adopted version control system. Set up a Git repository for your React Native project to track changes, collaborate with your team, and manage your codebase effectively.
- **Branching Strategy**: Define a branching strategy that includes clear guidelines for creating and merging branches. Common strategies include feature branches for new features or fixes, a development branch for ongoing work, and release branches for stable versions.
- **Commit Often and Descriptively**: Make frequent, small, and meaningful commits. Each commit should represent a single logical change, and commit messages should be descriptive, explaining why the change was made and how it impacts the project.
- **Code Reviews**: Integrate code reviews into your workflow to ensure that changes adhere to coding standards and best practices. Code reviews can catch issues early and improve code quality.
- **Pull Requests**: If using a platform like GitHub or GitLab, create pull requests (or merge requests) for code changes. Pull requests facilitate collaboration and provide a structured process for reviewing and merging code.
- **Tagging Releases**: Tag releases with version numbers to mark significant milestones in your project. This allows for easy reference and rollbacks.
- **Ignore Build Artifacts**: Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude build artifacts, temporary files, and sensitive information (like API keys) from version control to keep the repository clean.
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up Continuous Integration (CI) to automatically build, test, and deploy your React Native project. This ensures that code changes do not introduce regressions and helps maintain code quality.
- **Branch Protection**: Protect important branches (e.g., `main` or `develop`) to prevent force pushes and ensure that only approved contributors can merge changes.
- **Use Git Hooks**: Implement Git hooks to automate tasks such as linting and testing before allowing commits. This enforces code quality and standards.
- **Commit Message Conventions**: Follow a commit message convention (e.g., Conventional Commits) that allows for automated version bumping and changelog generation. This simplifies release management.
- **Documentation in Repository**: Include essential project documentation within the repository, such as a README file with setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and any relevant project information.

## Tools
- **Git**: Git is the most widely used distributed version control system. It provides excellent support for branching and merging, making it ideal for collaborative React Native projects. Git is the default choice for version control in most scenarios.
- **GitHub**: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides Git repository hosting, collaboration, and code review features. It's an excellent choice for hosting your React Native project's code, managing issues, and collaborating with a team.
- **GitLab**: GitLab is another web-based platform that offers Git repository hosting, continuous integration, and collaboration tools. It's suitable for teams that prefer self-hosted solutions or need more control over their environment.
- **Bitbucket**: Bitbucket is an Atlassian product that provides Git and Mercurial repository hosting. It's suitable for teams using Atlassian's ecosystem or those who need features like Jira integration.
- **Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS)**: Azure DevOps offers Git repositories, continuous integration, and project management tools. It's a good choice for teams using the Microsoft ecosystem or looking for an all-in-one solution. 

	*For an average React Native application, Git is the fundamental version control tool, and GitHub is recommended as the platform for hosting your Git repositories. It offers an excellent balance of features, collaboration tools, and integrations, making it a widely used and trusted choice for most development teams.*
