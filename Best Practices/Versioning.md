# VERSIONING
## Bare Minimum
*entails enabling consistent development, effective collaboration, and clear communication about changes within the project*
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Adopt a clear versioning scheme following Semantic Versioning (SemVer) principles, consisting of major, minor, and patch version numbers. This helps communicate the nature of changes and ensures backward compatibility. For example, "major.minor.patch" (e.g., 1.0.0) signifies breaking changes, feature additions, and bug fixes.
- **Git Version Control:** Use a version control system like Git to manage and track changes in your app's source code. This includes creating branches for new features or bug fixes, committing code changes, and tagging versions in the repository. Git enables collaboration, history tracking, and easy version management.
- **Changelog:** Maintain a clear and well-documented changelog that summarizes the changes introduced in each version of your app. Include information on new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes. A changelog provides transparency to developers, making it easier to understand the impact of updates and ensures that all team members are on the same page regarding version changes.

## Best Practices
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Follow the SemVer standard when versioning your app and its dependencies. Use three-part version numbers (major.minor.patch) to communicate changes clearly. Increment the version number based on the nature of the changes (major for breaking changes, minor for new features, and patch for bug fixes).
- **Use Version Control:** Employ a version control system like Git to manage your app's source code. Create branches for new features or bug fixes, commit changes with meaningful messages, and use tags to mark specific versions. This allows for collaboration among team members and keeps a history of changes.
- **Changelog Documentation:** Maintain a changelog that documents changes in each version of your app. Describe new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes. Provide context and clear communication about what has been updated. Changelogs help developers and users understand the impact of version changes.
- **Automated Versioning:** Consider automating versioning by integrating tools or scripts that update version numbers and generate changelogs based on the code changes and commit messages. Automation can streamline the version management process.
- **Release Notes:** Include release notes along with your app versions to provide additional details about updates and changes. Release notes offer a more in-depth explanation of new features, improvements, and known issues.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Incorporate CI tools into your development workflow to automate versioning and testing. CI pipelines can trigger version updates, build and test your app, and publish new versions to app stores or distribution channels.
- **Dependency Management:** Apply version constraints for your app's dependencies to ensure compatibility and stability. Specify a range of acceptable versions to prevent breaking changes from unexpected dependency updates.
- **Branching Strategy:** Establish a clear branching strategy that defines how feature branches, bug fix branches, and main development branches are created and merged. This ensures organized and controlled development.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Strive to maintain backward compatibility as much as possible. When introducing breaking changes, communicate them clearly in the changelog and update your app's documentation to assist developers with the transition.
- **Version History**: Maintain a historical record of your app's versions, making previous versions accessible for users or for reference when troubleshooting issues.

## Tools
- **Git**: Git is the most widely used version control system for managing the source code of your React Native project. It allows you to create branches for new features or bug fixes, commit changes, and tag versions. Git is essential for tracking and controlling your app's development process.
- **[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)**: SemVer is not a tool itself but a versioning standard. It's highly recommended for your React Native project. SemVer defines version numbers as major.minor.patch, helping you communicate changes clearly. Increment the version number based on the nature of the changes, ensuring backward compatibility.
- **GitHub or GitLab**: Platforms like GitHub and GitLab provide hosting for Git repositories and offer collaboration tools, issue tracking, and pull request management. They are excellent choices for hosting your React Native project's code, especially if you have multiple team members working on it.
- **Bitbucket**: Bitbucket is another platform for Git repositories and offers additional features such as built-in CI/CD pipelines and Jira integration. It's a solid choice for version control and collaboration.
- **Version Control in Package Managers**: Some package managers, like npm and Yarn, have built-in version control features for managing package dependencies. You can specify version ranges in your package.json or yarn.lock files to control which versions of libraries your app uses.

	*For an average React Native application, using Git for version control and following Semantic Versioning (SemVer) principles is the top recommendation. Git provides a solid foundation for managing your app's source code, while SemVer ensures clear versioning of your app and its dependencies.*
